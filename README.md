Hello, thank you for taking the time out to look at my profile I really appreciate your interest in me!

Here is a little information about me and my interests:
* I am Data Scientist with a passion for visualizing key insights of what I find when analyzing data.
* I have an unhealthy love for all thing tech-related, I blame video games for striking that passion at a young age.
* Deep learning is awesome, making models that are structed loosely like the human brain is beyond insighful and just interesting in general.

During my time learning about data science I have gained a few skills that help me do the job well. 
* Data analysis
* Python 
* ETL Pipeline
* Deploying with AWS
* SQL
* Knowledge on how to leverage data science libraries such as sci-kit learn, Tensorflow, SciPy, Pandas, NumPy.
